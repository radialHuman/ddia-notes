# Preface
- people who code for money, dont know the history of coding
- like pop culture they dislike the history
- buzz words in server side and BE systems for storage and processing 
    - big data, acid, cap, sharding
    - nosql, web scale, eventual consistency, cloud, map reduce, realtime
- internet companies handle huge traffic and data, forcing them to develop new tools for such scale
    - agile, test hypothesis, and dve cycle must be short
    - free and open s/w are now prefered
    - cpu clock speeds are stagnant 
    - but multi core processes are std
    - n/w are getting faster, : || must increase
- easy to create distributed across machines and regions using IAAS
- high available is in demand
- dia : if data is the challenge
    - quantity, complexity and speed of change
    - not compute intensive where cpus are the bottle neck
- new dbs : no sql are getting attention
    - but queues, cache,search index, for batch and stream process are imp too
- s/w eng and archit. must have knowledge of tech and trade offs for the optimum solution
- behind the tech, there are princicples that remain true : need to understand those, and find a good fit and avoid pit falls
- goal : navigate landscape for processing and storage of data
- popular application system design discussed
    - understand the principles and trade off
    - how why and what questions to ask
    - which tech is apt where : pros cons
    - and how to combine them for best solution
    - make good design decisions
- books for : server and backend for storage or processing or web applciation
- n/w ing, web app dev exp with sql experience
- scalable for Ms of user, highly available, opertionaly robust, easy to maintain in the long term with changes in req and growth
    - waste of time : building for scale you dont need
    - choose the right tools : sql not the only option
- breaks down : internal of dbs and data processing system
- Scope :
    - doesn have installation guide
    - principles and trade off fundamental to data systems
    - design decision of products
    - arhcitecture of data system and integration
    - deployment sec and mgmt are not in this book
    - mostly dealing with "big data" related tools
    - make things clear using the right terms
    - biased towards os and free s/w
- Outine:
    - part 1 : fundamental ideas of data intensive applications
        - chapter 1 : reliability scaling and maintaining, how to think about them
        - chapter 2 : compare data models and query languaes
        - chapter 3 : how dbs work
        - chapter 4 : data encoding, serialization and schemas
    - part 2 : distributed data
        - chapter 5 : replication
        - chapter 6 : partition and sharding
        - chapter 7 : transaction
        - chapter 8 : problems of distributed system
        - chapter 9 : consistency and consensus in dist. system
    - part 3 : derived data, heterogeneous system
        - chapter 10 : batch processing, 
        - chapter 11 : stream
        - chapter 12 : combine them all
